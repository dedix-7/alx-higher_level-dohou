len() - This function determines the length of a string

.lower() -> This method converts a string to all lowercase letters

.upper() -> This method converts a string to all uppercase letters.

.rstrip() -> This method removes whitespace from the right side of a string.

.lstrip() -> This method removes whitespace from the left side of a string.

.strip() -> This method removes whitespace from both sides of a string at the same time.

.startswith() -> This method checks if a string starts with a string. Note that this method is ##case sensitive##

.endswith() -> This method checks if a string starts with a string. Note that this method is ##case sensitive##
