This file contains all the functions and methods I came accross while learning Kotlin:

str.isidentifier() -> This method tells if a string is a valid identifier.

len() - This function determines the length of a string

.lower() -> This method converts a string to all lowercase letters

.upper() -> This method converts a string to all uppercase letters.

.rstrip() -> This method removes whitespace from the right side of a string.

.lstrip() -> This method removes whitespace from the left side of a string.

.strip() -> This method removes whitespace from both sides of a string at the same time.

.startswith() -> This method checks if a string starts with a string. Note that this method is ##case sensitive##

.endswith() -> This method checks if a string starts with a string. Note that this method is ##case sensitive##

str() -> This function converts the number assigned to a variable into a string. Use case: str(name_of_var). This function is also used on number literals (Use case: str(10))

.find() -> This method helps to find the location of a string in another string (commonly referred to as a substring). The method returns the index of the string that the substring starts with (the beginning character of the substring).
