In this project, I learned how to use streams, file objects to perform input and output operations.

Some of the concepts covered in this project are:
- What a file-object / stream is
- The Python Input and Output module
- How to open a file
- How to write data into a file
- Modes in which files are open
- Modes used to perform input/output operations
- How to close a file
- Text files
- Binary files (`b`)
- Reading the full content of a file
- Using a `with	 statement
- The JSON module
- Meaning of JSON
- How to serialize and deserialize data in JSON
- The JSON methods:
	- `dump`
	- `dumps`
	- `load`
	- `loads`
- Converting between Python Data structures and JSON representations, and vice versa.
