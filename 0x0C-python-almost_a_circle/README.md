## 0x0C. Python - Almost A Circle

In this project, I prepare for the AirBnB project by revisiting all the basics of Python in previous ALX SE Python projects.

In this project, I revisit the following Python concepts:
- Import and Export
- Exceptions
- Classes
- Private Attributes
- Getters and Setters
- Class Methods
- Static Methods
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Input / Output
- Reading and Writing Files
- `args` and `kwargs`
- Serialization and Deserialization
- JSON
